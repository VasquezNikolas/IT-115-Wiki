        <h2>Pre-Modern AI (Ancient Times - 1950s):</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence
          traces back to ancient mythology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Middle Ages witnessed the creation of automata and mechanical devices,
          demonstrating early attempts at mimicking human-like movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The foundation for AI was laid in the field of logic and formal
          reasoning.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="birth-of-ai">
        <h2>The Birth of AI (1950s - 1960s):</h2>
        <p>
          The term "artificial intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy in 1956
          during the Dartmouth Conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early AI research emphasized symbolic reasoning and problem-solving,
          envisioning intelligence through rule-based systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logic Theorist, developed by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon,
          marked an early AI program capable of solving mathematical problems.
        </p>

      <section id="ai-winter">
        <h2>AI Winter (1970s - 1980s):</h2>
        <p>
          Unrealistic expectations, limited computational power, and challenges
          in natural language processing led to the "AI winter," characterized
          by reduced funding and interest in AI research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expert systems, rule-based systems mimicking human decision-making,
          gained prominence during this period.
        </p>

      <section id="resurgence-with-ml">
        <h2>Resurgence with Machine Learning (1980s - 1990s):</h2>
        <p>
          Focus shifted from rule-based systems to machine learning, employing
          statistical methods for pattern recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rediscovery of backpropagation, a method for training neural
          networks, sparked renewed interest in AI.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="rise-of-applications">
